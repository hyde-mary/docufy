# üöÄ For Contributions:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/hyde-mary/docufy.git
```

<br>

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

<br>

3. Create Accounts for the following service providers:

You will need accounts for:
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) (Authentication)
- [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) (Database and backend)

After creating accounts, create a new project inside each platform.
- You need to set up Clerk with Convex using their JWT template integration. 
Follow the [documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk) provided by Convex for this.
- You also need to set up Webhooks for Clerk and Convex. Follow Convex's 
[Documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth#set-up-webhooks) for this.

<br>

4. Set up Environment Variables 

Copy the provided `.env.local.sample` and rename it to `.env.local`

```bash
# Provided after setting up Convex. This might be automatically provided once you run Npx Convex Dev.
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=

# Provided by Clerk. You get this after creating an account.
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# Fixed routes for Clerk auth redirection
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
```

For convex, you typically need to run `npx convex dev` and it will guide you through the steps needed
in linking your account. It may provide the Environment Variables automatically.

<br>

5. Run the App by creating two terminals.
```bash
# terminal 1
npm run dev
```
```bash
# terminal 2
npx convex dev
```

<br>

6. Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
