      "# Getting Started\n\nWelcome to **Docufy**! This is your first step toward effortlessly creating and managing documentation for any project or use case.\n\n<br>\n\n## What is this project about?\n\n**Docufy** is a platform designed to simplify the process of creating and publishing documentation. We eliminate the need for technical setup, coding, or deployment—our platform does all the heavy lifting for you. \n\nWith **Docufy**, you can focus purely on writing your documentation while we handle the complexities of hosting and publishing it. Whether you're documenting a project, a process, or anything else, our intuitive editor helps you create simple but powerful documentation in no time.\n\n**No more worrying about setting up servers, choosing a tech stack, or dealing with deployments.** \n\n_Once you're done, your documentation can be published at your own choosing and accessible to your audience!_\n\n<br>\n\n## Project Inspired By\n\nHi there! I'm Hydemary, the creator of Docufy.\n\nThis project was inspired by the layout of **ShadCN UI's** documentation page. I loved the simplicity and clarity of their design, with a clean sidebar, navbar, and intuitive navigation. After seeing how effective and streamlined their approach was, I thought: \n\n_\"Why not create a full documentation editor that everyone can use with a similar layout?\"_\n\nMany modern documentation sites follow a similar structure, often with a sidebar and navbar for easy navigation. \n\n**Docufy** is built on this tried-and-true format, aiming to provide a seamless, accessible experience for anyone needing to create their own documentation, without the complexity of setting up a full website.\n\n<br />\n\n**On the side note:**\n\n_This side project also allows me to improve my programming abilities as it is my passion! A feedback on this project would of course be appreciated! The methods and code for this is quite rough I'll admit, so anything that can improve my overall knowledge is something that I'll love!_\n\n---\n\n**We’re excited to have you on board and can’t wait to see the documentation you create!**",

        "# Editor Toolbar\n\nSo when you landed in the editor page of Docufy, you were greeted by Docufy's Editor. This is the bread and butter of Docufy. \n\nThis is your way of interacting with the **documentation canvas** we provide to you.\n\nOn landing, there is a lot of stuff that might overwhelm you, but I will keep it fast and simple.\n\n<br>\n\n## Buttons on the Upper Left\n\n---\n\nThere are three buttons on the upper left. \n- **Back Button** - Once clicked it will take you back to the previous page\n- **A Hamburger Button** - Once clicked, it will either hide or unhide the toolbar. Hiding the toolbar allows you to view your documentation in its fully glory. So when it is not in used, you can simply hide it.\n- **A File Code Button** - This is on the right of the Hamburger Button. Simply this just opens the JSON Viewer Editor Extension for the toolbar. The JSON Viewer editor is simply  the raw data stored on our server about your \ndocumentation.\n\n<br>\n\n## Docufy's Editor\n---\n\n### Docufy's Editor's Header\n\nSo, the Docufy Editor, you know it is the editor bcause of the title and the version found on top. There is also a save button, as of right now, the saving of the documentation is manually done by pressing that button.\n\n<br>\n\n_I do plan to add an autosave using a debounce feature, but as of the writing of this documentation (I'm writing it using the editor to test for bugs XD) it is currently a manual save for now_\n\n### Docufy's Editor's Body\n\nSo for the main body, it consists of 3 main parts. \n- A way to edit the header of the page, it is named Header Options.\n- A way to edit the sidebar of the page, it is named Sidebar Options.\n- A way to edit what you are seeing right now, the Main Content. (This uses markdown, hooray!)\n\nThere are also guides and small texts that will aid you to give you knowledge on what that specific thing do.\n\n<br>\n\n### Docufy's Editor's Footer\n\nLastly but not the least, there's the footer for the editor. At the very bottom, there are three buttons.\n1. A **theme toggle** - clicking it will switch the current theme from light mode to dark mode.\n2. A **Single Arrow Head Button** - clicking it will move the editor to the opposite side of the screen.\n3. A **Two Arrow Together/Away Button** - This is tied to the JSON Viewer. It allows you to either put them away from each other, or put them together, next to each other.",

        "# Header Options\n\nNow let us talk about the header options: There are 4 important parts:\n1. Documentation Title\n2. Navigation Links\n3. Socials\n4. Theme Toggle\n\n## Documentation Title\n\n---\n\nSimply, as the title suggest, this is the title for your documentation. **It is found on the upper left**\n\nClicking it will also put you back to the main root page!\n\n## Navigation Links\n\n---\n\nOn the right of the title, you will see the navigation links. When you add a link, it will simply appear to the right of the title, or the previous link. These links can be clicked and will you will be taken to that respective page!\n\n**Really cool right! I'm really proud of it**\n\n*Note: As of right now, only 7 links can be added to reduce clutter! But it is okay since you do have an unlimited amount of links on the sidebar!*\n\n## Socials\n\n---\n\nAs of right now, these socials are predefined. We have three socials you can fill up:\n- Github\n- Facebook\n- Twitter\n\nI haven't thought of a really elegant way of facilitating a lot of socials, so as of right now, the limit is only 3. \n\nSo how does it work? Simply just provide the link and it will appear! Remove the link and it will vanish!\n\n**Really amazing right!**\n\n## Theme Toggle\n\n---\n\nOkay, so this theme toggle, is just a boolean, you either set it to true or you set it to false! This is different from the theme toggle at the bottom right of the editor. This theme toggle is specially for your documentation.\n\nWhat this means is that, if you wanted to add a theme toggle capability to your documentation, just simply turn it to true!",

        "# Sidebar Options\n\nThe sidebar options simply just consist of 1 main part. But that 1 main part, has three different sub-components you can use for your sidebar!\n\n<br>\n\n## What is the Sidebar Section?\n\n---\n\n- Simply, the sidebar section is located on the left, this can contain links that your users who visits your documentation can click to be redirected to another part of your documentation.\n- Simply, it is just a link to another page.\n\n### Text Section\nSo the text section, is self explanatory, it is a section mainly used to store texts. Looking on the left, the very first one is Getting Started.\n\nThis can be used to organize your sidebar much more cleanly!\n\n<br>\n\n### Link Section\n\n---\n\nThis makes the sidebar, the sidebar. Adding a link section, is a way for you to allow the user to get to a specific page.\n\nThis is also your main way of creating a page! Once you created a link section, and you provide a path for it:\n\nDocufy will **automatically** generate a page for you! Really cool right! \n\nThis is clickable right off the bat. So how do you create a link?\n\n1. Click the middle button, it says `+ Link`\n2. You will be asked for a **Link Name** and a **Link URL**\n    - For the Link Name: This is just a visual text that will appear on your documentation's sidebar\n    - For the Link URL: You can simply use /path format or simply just type the path: This will create a new path for you. For example, if you created a docs link, and you added `docs` or `/docs`, it will generate a page for you with a /docs page.\n    -  Important Note: You can technically create 2 different links that has the same Link URL. What this does though is it just creates a single page, since they point to the same page? Does that makes sense? But a 1 character difference will make make a new page for it! Really Cool!\n\n<br>\n\n### Dropdown Section\n\n---\n\nA dropdown section is simply a dropdown. Users can expand it or collapse it. You can add a name to that dropdown which the user can click and it will show all the items underneath the dropdown.\n\nYou can also add Link Items to that dropdown! It is just a basic way of further organizing your sidebar if that makes sense. ",

        "# Features\n\nFor the features of the application, there are two main componetns.\n- The project manager\n- The documentation editor\n\n---\n\n## Project Manager\n\nThe project manager is simply a way for the users to manage their projects. **Simply, in docufy, we will call a documentation as a \"project\".**\n\n### Features\n\n- Upon account creation, users are automatically provided with a **Getting Started** project to help them explore the app.\n\n- A sidebar is available for easy navigation. It includes:\n  - A **Home** link  \n  - A **Projects** dropdown listing all user-created projects  \n  - A **Trash** link for deleted projects  \n  - A **Publish** link for managing public visibility\n\n- The **Home** page displays all of the user's projects. It's currently minimal, but future updates will expand its functionality.\n\n- Clicking on a project takes the user to its **Overview** page. Here, users can:\n  - Edit the project's basic details  \n  - Manage project settings  \n  - Access the **Editor** to start working on content  \n\n- Deleting a project sends it to the **Trash**, where it is marked as pending deletion. Users can choose to either **restore** the project or **permanently delete** it.\n\n- When a project is published, its status changes from `active` to `published`, making it visible to everyone.\n\n- Users can create new projects by providing a **title**, **description**, and an **icon**.  \n  - There's also an option to choose a template. Currently, only one default layout is available.\n\n## Documentation Editor\n\nThe documentation editor is simply the phase before what you are seeing right now. This documentation you are seeing is written through the documentation editor provided by Docufy.\n\n### Features\n\n- An Editor where you can edit your documentation. It allows the editing of:\n    - The Header which is located at the top. The header consists of the following features:\n        - A documentation title\n        - Navigation links\n        - 3 Socials (Github, Facebook, and Twitter)\n        - A toggle to enable Theme-Toggle\n    - The Sidebar which is located at the left. The header consists of the following features:\n        - A text section for basic texts and organization.\n        - A link section for page links\n        - A dropdown section which can be named and can have multiple links.\n    - The Main content which is located at the middle. The main content simply supports markdown for rendering markdown content.\n    - The Headings sidebar which is located at the right. Simply, it indexes all headings in your markdown data, and when clicked, it will simply take you to that section.",

        "# Future Recommendations\n\nWhile working on this documentation, I came across several things I’d like to improve. I also noticed a few bugs and minor issues along the way. I tried fixing them as I went, but some were just a bit too tricky for my current skill level. There are also features that work fine—but I believe they could be better.\n\n---\n\n### Markdown Preview (Main Content)\n\n- The current markdown preview looks clean and minimal, which I love—but I think there’s room for improvement.\n- After completing most of the markdown setup, I remembered that there’s a **BlockNote plugin for React**. It might’ve made editing much easier.\n- That said, I decided to stick with the markdown approach for now. In the future, I’d love to offer both options and let users choose the editor that works best for them.\n\n---\n\n### Sidebar Spacing and Flexibility\n\n- The sidebar works well, but the spacing between sections feels a bit **too uniform**.\n- In the future, I plan to let users insert **\"break\" sections** to control spacing themselves. This gives them flexibility to organize their content however they prefer.\n\n---\n\n### Toolbar and Editor UX\n\n- The toolbar and editor are simple and functional, but there's definitely room for refinement.\n- Originally, I wanted users to type content into **predefined sections only** (no freeform editor), but that turned out to be way too complex. I might revisit that for the **Main Content** area in the future.\n- Toolbar placement is another UX concern:\n  - Right now, it’s fixed to the left—despite me personally using it on the right.\n  - I might implement a **\"remember last position\"** feature using `localStorage`, so users can place the toolbar where they prefer.\n\n---\n\n### Link Reordering\n\n- Currently, there's **no way to rearrange links** in the sidebar.\n- I think it would be a much better experience if users could **drag and reorder** their links or move them up/down as needed.\n\n---\n\n### Save and Auto-Save\n\n- There’s **no auto-save** yet, but the manual save feature works as expected.\n- This manual approach also helps reduce unnecessary server load.\n- As long as you save periodically and stay connected, it works just fine—for now.\n\n---\n\n### Template Support\n\n- I added a basic **template system** during project creation, but I’d love to expand on this.\n- In the future, users should be able to select from multiple templates, all rendered from a single data structure.\n- It’s totally manageable—it just needs some polish and design love.\n\n---\n\n### Custom Styling\n\n- Currently, the main content styling is **hardcoded in the markdown preview** component.\n- Eventually, I want to let users **fully customize** the appearance of their documentation.\n- This includes typography, colors, spacing—basically everything. The goal is to give them complete control over their design.\n\n---\n\n### Catch-All Page Support\n\n- Docufy doesn't yet support a **catch-all page**.\n- For example, if someone creates a page for `/introduction/features`, it will not render.\n- This is something I’d like to support in the future, as it would make multi-level routes and nested documentation more flexible and powerful.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThanks for reading all the way through. I really appreciate it. If you’re interested, you’ll find links about me and this project below.\n\nIf you're interested in the project. Here is the [Github Link](https://github.com/hyde-mary/docufy)\n\nWhile you are it, check some few of my projects in my profile, [hyde-mary](https://github.com/hyde-mary).\n\n**Again, thank you very much, see you on the next update i guess.**\n",
